Auto-Completion Sentence Project for Google Search Enhancement
Overview
The Auto-Completion Sentence Project aims to enhance user experience on Google Search by providing real-time predictive text completions. This system leverages a sophisticated backend that dynamically handles user inputs to suggest the most relevant completions based on prior data compiled from various technical documents and articles.
Project Structure
Main Components
1. DataManager: Manages the lifecycle of sentence data, from extraction and loading from a ZIP file to structuring this data for efficient access and manipulation.
2. SentencesTrie: Implements a trie data structure to store sentences and allow for rapid retrieval based on prefixes and other criteria derived from user input.
3. AutoCompletion: Orchestrates the retrieval and ranking of sentence completions based on a blend of exact matches and fuzzy logic to handle typos or varied input formats.
Functional Workflow
- Initialization: Pre-loads and organizes data from specified sources into a manageable format, ensuring readiness for real-time user interaction.
- Completion Handling: Receives user inputs and processes them to suggest up to five of the most accurate completions, utilizing a combination of exact match and proximity calculations.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
